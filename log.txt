	- started making the website. 
	- Currently the website has a navigation bar.
	- The navigation bar can upload files to the server. which will then be used for analyzing
	- The code for uploading the bar is written in PHP
	- Made a general layout of the website

Zayan
	- found more databases for us to analyze
	- got a data base of the wealth distribution of the world
		- thinking about how to display that information in a graphical format
		- came up with a couple different ideas, decided to find a better source online 	
	- found the percentage of user usage of all the search engines
		- The website seems to be credible but the data does not seem to be very accurate
		- found online data that does not allign with the current information	
	- found a database on the price of weed through the world
		- Although this is something that we are not going to use
		- finding this still had value. 
		- It gave us ideas for how we are going to display our informaiton and may be able to show a different set of information in the same manor	


Together
	- started looking into how the backend of our program will work.
	- setup a spring environment so we can write the server code in java. 
		- This will allow us to program in an environment we are comfortable.
	- Setup a website in spring, Currently it just says hello world and is hosted by pivotal webservices. 
	- http://ahmedtest.cfapps.io/
	- going to start combining all our code here




April 1st

- We decided to go with Ahmed's project
	- program that analyzes and visualizes data sets

- We picked a name for the program. We called it PlotMe

We tested out a variety of libraries to help us draw graphs and we found d3js to be the best one. 
We decided to make our project using the d3js library written in javascript. 


We gave all the members there individual tasks

- Zayan is responsible for getting and parsing data.
- Saim is responsible for making the UI.
- Ahmed is responsible for finding ways to analyze the data.


We wrote our requirement specification.


- Zayan found a few interesting data sets and is finding ways to parse it effectively

- Saim managed to got the design of the user interface on paper.

- Ahmed managed to draw sample graphs from a file that was parsed by zayan.
