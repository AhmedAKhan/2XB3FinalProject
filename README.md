# 2XB3FinalProject

this is the repository for the final project for 2xb3. 

It is going to be a website that lets you analyze data.

This is how I setup this git
There will always be two branches, master and development.
The development branch will contain the work that is working and has been tested.
The master branch contains that last piece of code that was submitted for milestones 
Now if you want to add new features and update the code create a new branch from the development branch. This will be a branch that only you will use. do as many commits or changes it takes to add the feature or whatever you were trying to add. then merge it to back to the development branch.
