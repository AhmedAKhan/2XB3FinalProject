To add or remove data just update the visit-sequences.csv file

This is how the data is stored

//this would be the base value, the one at the bottom
<name>, <value>

//this represents a middle child
<parentName>-<childName>,<value>


Features:

works with data that is in a CSV format (you don't need to pre-generate a hierarchical JSON file, unless your data file is very large)
interactive breadcrumb trail helps to emphasize the sequence, so that it is easy for a first-time user to understand what they are seeing
percentages are shown explicitly, to help overcome the distortion of the data that occurs when using a radial presentation
If you want to simply reuse this with your own data, here are some tips for generating the CSV file:

no header is required (but it's OK if one is present)
use a hyphen to separate the steps in the sequence
the step names should be one word only, and ideally should be kept short. Non-alphanumeric characters will probably cause problems (I haven't tested this).
every sequence should have an "end" marker as the last element, unless it has been truncated because it is longer than the maximum sequence length (6, in the example). The purpose of the "end" marker is to distinguish a true end point (e.g. the user left the site) from an end point that has been forced by truncation.
each line should be a complete path from root to leaf - don't include counts for intermediate steps. For example, include "home-search-end" and "home-search-product-end" but not "home-search" - the latter is computed by the partition layout, by adding up the counts of all the sequences with that prefix.
to keep the number of permutations low, use a small number of unique step names, and a small maximum sequence length. Larger numbers of either of these will lead to a very large CSV that will be slow to process (and therefore require pre-processing into hierarchical JSON).
