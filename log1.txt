- We decided to go with Ahmed's project
	- program that analyzes and visualizes data sets

- We picked a name for the program. We called it PlotMe

We tested out a variety of libraries to help us draw graphs and we found d3js to be the best one. 
We decided to make our project using the d3js library written in javascript. 


We gave all the members there individual tasks

- Zayan is responsible for getting and parsing data.
- Saim is responsible for making the UI.
- Ahmed is responsible for finding ways to analyze the data.


We wrote our requirement specification.

- Saim managed to got the design of the user interface on paper.

- Ahmed managed to draw sample graphs from a file that was parsed by zayan.
