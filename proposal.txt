• Abstract: 
	- describes the highlights of the proposal (the problem, the solution, the dataset and experiments for verification and validation). (max: 150 words) Hint: you will write the abstract after writing your proposal!



• Objectives and scope of the project: 
	- concisely describe the problem that you are interested to solve. You should include a background study and the context of the application. You can use symbolic notations or figures to describe the problem. Then you will describe your tasks (what your implementation will accomplish) to address the problem. You will also include in this section your motivation for selecting this topic. You will describe why you think it is important to solve this problem. (max: 500 words)

There is alot of open data publicly available on the internet available for everyone to use except the problem is that it is invconvenient to find and work wiith. It takes a long amount of time and energy to find all the data that you need. 
This problem we can solve by fd

• Input/output: 
	- describes the type of input datasets (and the source of the dataset) that you will be using to evaluate your application and the type of output that you will be generating. (max: 200 words)

• Algorithmic challenges of the project: 
	- describes which algorithms (sorting, searching, graphs, strings, etc.) you think you will be implementing to solve this problem and what are the challenges that you should be aware of. (max: 200 words)

• Project timetable: 
	- describes the timeline of the project with a list of milestones, and deliverables. The list should not exceed 7 milestones. You should use a table or a gantt chart to describe your timetable. (max word: 150 words)

• References: 
	- use a consistent format (IEEE, APA, etc.) for your references.

There is alot of open data online, It is available on the internet for everyone to access except the problem is, its just inconvenient to find and work with. What we are going to make is a program that lets you use and analayze all that data in a more visual formal and workable format. 
- categorize the data according to age, ethinicity, gender, for things like internet time spent, disease, 
- sell it to marketers
- you can predict future crime, you can help the future 
- find disease groups, help prevent disease by finding where its popular, 
- figure out why crime rate is higher in certain people
- if an age group have high suicide rate figure out why. 
- monitor new born disease


IDEA: take the open data from the government and categorize it, After categorizing it map it with respect to age, gender, wage, location.  it finds the correlation of the data with that group. If the correlation is to high it then gives you that data and graph for you to analyze. So you can figure out why and help find a solution. 
For example: Lets say it takes in the crime and it graphs with respect to location, graphs it with respect to age, gender, 

- There is alot of open data freely available for use but it is very overwhelming to use. To get something as simple as crime rate can be retrieved from the government websites but takes alot of effort, patience, and manual labor. It is alot of hassle to even get a simple data set let alone start to analyze it. 
- We will make a website that will allow you to easily sort and easily manipulate that data. Firstly it will be able to take all the data from all the different government websites and combine it into one simple place for you to access. 
- The next step will be to sort that data with respect to age, gender, wealth, ethnicity, race, culture, geographic location and so on. If it finds any two variables to be very closely correlated


IDEA:
